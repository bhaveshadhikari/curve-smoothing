## Note

This document provides the mathematical background required for curve smoothing. The write-up is based on self-study during coursework in Calculus, Differential Equations, and Numerical Methods.

The expressions, formulas, and their subsequent [implementation](../mathematical_background/Variational_Methods_in_Trajectory_Optimization__A_Calculus_Based_Approach_to_Stroke_Smoothing.pdf) are presented according to my current understanding. They are intended for exploratory and experimental purposes and **should not be considered formal proofs or definitive theoretical guarantees**.

The goal of this document is to support intuition and practical implementation.
